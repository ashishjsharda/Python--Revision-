## What is Supervised Learning?

Supervised learning is a machine learning approach where algorithms learn from labeled training data to make predictions or decisions on new, unseen data.

**Core Components:**
- **Training Data:** Historical examples with known outcomes
- **Features (Independent Variables):** Input attributes used for prediction
- **Labels (Dependent Variables):** Known correct answers or outcomes
- **Algorithm:** Mathematical model that identifies patterns in the data

### Business Context
Think of supervised learning like training a new employee:
- You provide them with case studies (training data)
- They learn to recognize patterns and best practices
- Eventually, they can handle new situations independently
- Their performance improves with more experience and feedback

### Common Applications
- **Finance:** Credit scoring, fraud detection, algorithmic trading
- **Healthcare:** Diagnostic assistance, drug discovery, treatment recommendations
- **Marketing:** Customer segmentation, churn prediction, recommendation systems
- **Operations:** Quality control, demand forecasting, maintenance scheduling

## Example 1: Temperature Classification

Let's build a model to classify temperatures as comfortable or uncomfortable for office environments.

### Dataset

| Temperature (°F) | Comfort Level |
|------------------|---------------|
| 60° | Uncomfortable |
| 70° | Comfortable |
| 72° | Comfortable |
| 68° | Comfortable |
| 78° | Uncomfortable |
| 75° | Comfortable |
| 82° | Uncomfortable |
| 65° | Uncomfortable |

### Implementation

```python
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score, classification_report

# Dataset
temperatures = np.array([60, 70, 72, 68, 78, 75, 82, 65])
comfort_labels = np.array([0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0])  # 0=Uncomfortable, 1=Comfortable

print("Training Dataset:")
for temp, comfort in zip(temperatures, comfort_labels):
    status = "Comfortable" if comfort == 1 else "Uncomfortable"
    print(f"  {temp}°F → {status}")

# Simple threshold-based approach
def find_optimal_threshold(temps, labels):
    best_threshold = None
    best_accuracy = 0
    
    for threshold_low in range(65, 75):
        for threshold_high in range(75, 80):
            # Define comfort zone
            predictions = ((temps >= threshold_low) & (temps <= threshold_high)).astype(int)
            accuracy = accuracy_score(labels, predictions)
            
            if accuracy > best_accuracy:
                best_accuracy = accuracy
                best_threshold = (threshold_low, threshold_high)
    
    return best_threshold, best_accuracy

optimal_range, accuracy = find_optimal_threshold(temperatures, comfort_labels)
print(f"\nOptimal comfort range: {optimal_range[0]}°F - {optimal_range[1]}°F")
print(f"Training accuracy: {accuracy:.2%}")

# Apply the rule
predictions = ((temperatures >= optimal_range[0]) & 
               (temperatures <= optimal_range[1])).astype(int)

# Test on new data
new_temperatures = np.array([66, 73, 79, 85])
new_predictions = ((new_temperatures >= optimal_range[0]) & 
                   (new_temperatures <= optimal_range[1])).astype(int)

print("\nPredictions for new temperatures:")
for temp, pred in zip(new_temperatures, new_predictions):
    status = "Comfortable" if pred == 1 else "Uncomfortable"
    print(f"  {temp}°F → {status}")
```

### Visualization

```python
plt.figure(figsize=(12, 6))

# Plot training data
colors = ['red' if comfort == 0 else 'green' for comfort in comfort_labels]
plt.scatter(temperatures, comfort_labels, c=colors, s=100, alpha=0.7, label='Training Data')

# Add comfort zone
plt.axvspan(optimal_range[0], optimal_range[1], alpha=0.2, color='green', 
           label=f'Comfort Zone ({optimal_range[0]}°F - {optimal_range[1]}°F)')

# Plot new predictions
plt.scatter(new_temperatures, new_predictions, c='blue', s=100, 
           marker='^', label='New Predictions')

plt.xlabel('Temperature (°F)')
plt.ylabel('Comfort Level')
plt.title('Office Temperature Comfort Classification')
plt.yticks([0, 1], ['Uncomfortable', 'Comfortable'])
plt.legend()
plt.grid(True, alpha=0.3)
plt.show()
```

## Example 2: Height Classification

Developing a model to classify individuals as above or below average height for ergonomic workplace design.

### Dataset

| Height (inches) | Category |
|----------------|----------|
| 62" | Below Average |
| 68" | Average/Above |
| 70" | Average/Above |
| 64" | Below Average |
| 72" | Average/Above |
| 59" | Below Average |
| 74" | Average/Above |
| 66" | Below Average |

### Implementation

```python
import numpy as np
from sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression
from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score, confusion_matrix
import seaborn as sns

# Dataset
heights = np.array([62, 68, 70, 64, 72, 59, 74, 66])
height_category = np.array([0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0])  # 0=Below Average, 1=Average/Above

# Find threshold using domain knowledge (average adult height ~67 inches)
threshold = 67
manual_predictions = (heights >= threshold).astype(int)
manual_accuracy = accuracy_score(height_category, manual_predictions)

print(f"Manual threshold ({threshold}\"): {manual_accuracy:.2%} accuracy")

# Performance analysis
print("\nClassification Report (Manual Threshold):")
print(f"True Negatives: {np.sum((manual_predictions == 0) & (height_category == 0))}")
print(f"False Positives: {np.sum((manual_predictions == 1) & (height_category == 0))}")
print(f"False Negatives: {np.sum((manual_predictions == 0) & (height_category == 1))}")
print(f"True Positives: {np.sum((manual_predictions == 1) & (height_category == 1))}")
```

### Model Comparison

```python
# Compare different thresholds
thresholds = range(60, 75)
accuracies = []

for t in thresholds:
    pred = (heights >= t).astype(int)
    acc = accuracy_score(height_category, pred)
    accuracies.append(acc)

# Find best threshold
best_idx = np.argmax(accuracies)
best_threshold = thresholds[best_idx]
best_accuracy = accuracies[best_idx]

print(f"\nOptimal threshold: {best_threshold}\" (accuracy: {best_accuracy:.2%})")

# Visualization
plt.figure(figsize=(10, 6))
plt.plot(thresholds, accuracies, 'b-', linewidth=2)
plt.axvline(x=best_threshold, color='red', linestyle='--', 
           label=f'Optimal threshold: {best_threshold}"')
plt.xlabel('Height Threshold (inches)')
plt.ylabel('Accuracy')
plt.title('Threshold Optimization for Height Classification')
plt.legend()
plt.grid(True, alpha=0.3)

# Define comfort as temperatures between 68-76°F
comfort_labels = ((temperatures >= 68) & (temperatures <= 76)).astype(int)

# Add some noise to make it more realistic
noise_indices = np.random.choice(100, 10, replace=False)
comfort_labels[noise_indices] = 1 - comfort_labels[noise_indices]

# Prepare data for sklearn (requires 2D array)
X = temperatures.reshape(-1, 1)
y = comfort_labels

# Split data into training and testing sets
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.3, random_state=42)

print(f"Training set size: {len(X_train)}")
print(f"Test set size: {len(X_test)}")

## Key Concepts and Terminology

### Essential Definitions

**Supervised Learning:** Machine learning approach using labeled training data to learn a mapping function from inputs to outputs.

**Features/Predictors:** Independent variables used as input to the model (e.g., temperature, height, age).

**Labels/Target:** Dependent variable that the model aims to predict (e.g., comfort level, category).

**Training Set:** Subset of data used to train the model.

**Test Set:** Subset of data used to evaluate model performance on unseen data.

**Overfitting:** When a model performs well on training data but poorly on new data.

**Underfitting:** When a model is too simple to capture underlying patterns in the data.

### Model Evaluation Metrics

**Accuracy:** Percentage of correct predictions out of total predictions.

**Precision:** Of all positive predictions, how many were actually positive?

**Recall (Sensitivity):** Of all actual positives, how many were correctly identified?

**F1-Score:** Harmonic mean of precision and recall.

**Confusion Matrix:** Table showing correct vs. incorrect predictions by class.

### Types of Supervised Learning

**Classification:** Predicting discrete categories or classes
- Binary: Two classes (spam/not spam, approve/reject)
- Multi-class: Multiple classes (low/medium/high risk)

**Regression:** Predicting continuous numerical values
- Linear regression, polynomial regression
- Predicting prices, temperatures, sales figures
