# Python Data Structures

## Course Overview
This 45-minute tutorial covers advanced Python data structures with a focus on tuples, sets, dictionaries, and sequence operations. These powerful built-in data structures are essential for writing efficient and readable Python code.

## Learning Objectives
By the end of this session, you will be able to:
- Choose the appropriate data structure for different programming scenarios
- Create and manipulate tuples, sets, and dictionaries effectively
- Apply sequence operations consistently across different data types
- Combine multiple data structures to solve complex problems

## Materials Included
- **Practice Worksheet**: Contains explanations, examples, and exercises
- **Solution Guide**: Provides detailed solutions to all problems
- **Lesson Plan**: Outlines the structure of the class

## Prerequisites
